# Python-Mini-Project.
I was told, in this project, I have to find if it is possible to cut the cake in the below mentioned ways for a given value of N. 
The statement given to me was, given an integer N and a cake which can be cut into pieces, each cut should be a straight line 
going from the center of the cake to its border. Also, the angle between any two cuts must be a positive integer. 
Two pieces are equal if their appropriate angles are equal. The given cake can be cut in following three ways: 
•	Cut the cake into N equal pieces.
•	Cut the cake into N pieces of any size.
• Cut the cake into N pieces such that no two of them are equal.
